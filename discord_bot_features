Below are a list of functions needed before we officially launch

Announcements:
- We will be posting announcements so members can keep updated and feel involved with the community
- Much like the announcements that are posted on the Null Reality Discord server

EXP/Leveling system:
- The purpose is to keep users active and involved with the Discord server
- Users will be able to type a command such as !level in any text channel and have the bot PM them personally
- The bot will also automatically delete any commands entered by users to keep the chat clean
- Ways to gain levels and experience can be negotiated
